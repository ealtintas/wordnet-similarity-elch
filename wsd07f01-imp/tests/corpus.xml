Their multiscreen projections of slides and film loops have featured in orbital parties, at the Astoria and Heaven, in Rifat Ozbek's 1988/89 fashion shows, and at Energy's recent Docklands all-dayer.
From their residency at the Fridge during the first summer of love, Halo used slide and film projectors to throw up a collage of op-art patterns, film loops of dancers like E-Boy and Wumni, and unique fractals derived from video feedback.
&bquo;We're not aware of creating a visual identify for the house scene, because we're right in there.

Leeds is well-equipped for sports, with 21 golf courses and 22 sports and leisure centres, but if all this action leaves you feeling in need of a rest, you can always take yourself off to the theatre.
Leeds has four to choose from.
Most famous is the Leeds City Varieties, one of the oldest music halls in the country and home of BBC TV's [hi]The Good Old Days [/hi].
There's also the Grand Theatre, which hosts touring companies and is the permanent home of Opera North. [/p] [p]

In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.
The individual &bquo;good&equo; work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.
But it can only be a quirk; and the force of its &bquo;goodness&equo; is strictly limited and circumscribed.
Only once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.
But even this is done in the name of a supposed &bquo;immediate sensuous charge&equo; rather than any more extended critical capacity of <head>art</head>or the aesthetic.

The Chairman of the Chambre Nationale, Yannick Guilloux, said the charges brought against Britain must not be seen as the stand of one European country against another but a bid to harmonise tax regulation, at as low a rate as possible, in order to protect the art market within the EC as a whole.
The Commission normally takes two months to investigate charges, after which it could either instruct Britain to set its VAT rates in conformity with European legislation or proceed to put into effect the long awaited 7th Directive on fiscal matters.
A meeting of Ministers last month was once again unable to reach agreement on VAT. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

Many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child play or in the arts, the former finding clues in the activity which relate to child development, the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is good and beautiful.
Narrowing the field to either one or the other of these, has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identified a defining characteristic of their field.
For instance, Arnaud Reid (1982), in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is the requirement of &bquo;aesthetic intention&equo;, explains: [quote] [p]
For &mdash; cutting straight through the recurring controversies about whether, because of the varieties of the arts and of the infinity of differences between different individual works, &bquo;art&equo; can be &bquo;defined&equo; &mdash; one thing, I think, is clear.
There is something common to all our experiences of <head>art</head> , of whatever kind &mdash; music, poetry, painting&hellip;, each art concretely utterly different from the others.

Yet Modigliani was too much a part of the life of Montparnasse, too involved with the individuals leading the &bquo;new art&equo;, to remain completely aloof.
In 1914 he had met Hans Arp, the French painter who was to become prominent in the new Dada movement, at the artists' canteen in the Avenue du Maine.
Two years later Arp was living in Zurich, a member of a group of talented &eacute;migr&eacute; artists who had left their own countries because of the war.
Through casual meetings at caf&eacute;s, the artists drew together to form a movement in protest against the waste of war, against nationalism and against everything pompous, conventional or boring in the <head>art</head>of the Western world.

For her latest exhibition, Oulton has gone even further to distance herself from Old Master traditions and concepts of Englishness.
Out have gone the autumnal shades, in have come bold contrasts of saturated reds and greens.
Where before Oulton teased her interpreters with titles such as &bquo;Lachrimae&equo; and &bquo;Vanitas&equo;, her new paintings have sterner names such as &bquo;Transparence No 7&equo;. [/p] [p]
We can now see that Oulton's art has followed a wilfully individual path, avoiding too close an association with any fashionable cause, and managing to remain relevant in a trecherous time.

But the pervasive and insidious presence throughout the novel of manifestations of Quechua culture suggests the ability of that culture not only to survive in an alien environment, but also, as it itself is modified, to exercise an &bquo;Indianizing&equo; influence on the country as a whole.
However, such works do not merely show the dominant culture being resisted and subverted by popular culture; in their form, they themselves have been influenced by the culture which they depict.
[hi]The Fox Above and the Fox Below [/hi], for example, is structured on Andean organizing principles and develops a style of &bquo;oral writing&equo; that transposes popular Quechua <head>art</head>forms to the printed page, and Rowe notes &bquo;the compositional impact of popular oral culture in Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, that of Guarani culture in Roa Bastos, and of middle-American culture in Asturias&equo; (Rowe 1984: 85).

Academies of art, whether in the West or in the Orient, have had lists of priorities in themes of art, in which there are many similarities.
For example, in twelfth-century China, a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings: Taoist and Buddhist subjects, human affairs, palaces and other buildings, foreign tribes, dragons and fishes, landscapes, animals, flowers and birds, ink bamboos, and finally vegetables and fruit.
This sort of listing is worth knowing by a reader, who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
THE SURVEY WITH A THEORY [/head] [p]

Michael Edwards, taking a paradoxical approach, has argued that the English have always been strong on literary theory, instancing a distinguished succession of poet-critics: Sidney, Dryden, Johnson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Arnold, Eliot.
Most of their important critical texts, Edwards remarks, are theoretical, in that they prompt fundamental reflections about the basic nature of writing, even if, &bquo;One notices about such writing that it does not necessarily offer itself as theory, that it is directed towards what we now call literature and not towards something else.&equo;
[pb] Edward's comment is clearly correct, and could be extended: Hopkins's letters and notebooks, for instance, contain a weight of original theorizing that is more substantial and more interesting than much recent writing.
But present-day theorists are likely to be dismissive of what has been called &bquo;writers' speculation about their <head>art</head> &equo;, finding it impressionistic and unsystematic.

The SI thus rejected &bquo;mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession&equo;.
This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.
In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).
He does this by proclaiming, a &bquo;third avant-garde&equo;, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the &bquo;two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.
However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected [pb] means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of <head>art</head>in the praxis of life might be achieved. [/p] [p]

Before 1914, war propaganda had not been traditionally a British trait and the authorities leaned to use it following the examples of the French and Germans.
For this purpose, new institutions were created, such as the Ministry for Information and the War Museum, and special administrative officers appointed, like John Buchan and Lord Rothermere in the First World War, Sir Kenneth Clark in the Second.
They were responsible for appointing war artists.
Prominent in artist-ministry public relations was the etcher Muirhead Bone, who was also the first British War Artist, serving as such in both World Wars.
Himself a traditional artist, he recommended a variety of colleagues of widely differing styles, including Epstein and Stanley Spencer.
Continuing this tradition, Kenneth Clark selected artists of individual vision for these rather establishmentarian posts, stressing the importance of their work as <head>art</head> . [/p] [p]

The daring magnitude of this conception has since been obscured by its almost routine enactment in a series of African countries in the 1960s, but it should never be forgotten that India was the test case, and that at the time success in the execution of such a plan seemed far from assured: only a year before Mountbatten's appointment the then viceroy, Lord Wavell, had been pressing on the Cabinet his &bquo;Breakdown Plan&equo;, which consisted simply of the phased evacuation of the British from India without any serious attempt to ensure that a viable, much less friendly, government was installed in their place.
&bquo;That would indeed&equo;, Attlee told the Cabinet, &bquo;be an inglorious end to our long association with India&equo;, and he set his face firmly against such a course.
Instead, he gambled on finding someone who could play the last card in the British deck &mdash; independence &mdash; and then, with nothing further to offer, keep sufficient control of the situation to extricate Britain from India with honour and possibly with glory.
The last viceroyalty was thus conceived &mdash; by, of all people, a Labour prime minister, but one, it must be remembered, who was at Haileybury &mdash; as a supreme test of British adeptness in the gentlemanly <head>art</head>of leadership.

As well as a facsimile of the Mannerist painter's diary, it contains three texts by Jean-Claude Lebensztejn: a commentary, an analysis of his life as seen by Vasari, and a long essay on the Santa Felicit&aacute; &bquo;Deposition&equo;.
Another book by the same publisher/author team, though covering a completely different period, is due to appear in June 1993.
Ecrits sur l'art r&eacute;cent: Marden, Morley, Sharits is a 140-page work on three artists representative of American <head>art</head>in the 1970s.

When the historian Asa Briggs examined their backgrounds he found that fifty-six of them had been university educated, forty at Oxford or Cambridge.
The three schools of Eton, Harrow and Winchester accounted for twenty governors.
Among the thirty-eight who had been politically active, there were more than twice as many Conservatives as anything else &mdash; nineteen were Tories, seven Liberal and eight Labour.
Their average age on taking up their post was fifty-four.
Although appointed to represent a cross-section of British life &mdash; one each from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; at least one academic; one trade unionist (almost always from the right-wing of the movement); one with an interest in the <head>arts</head> ; usually a scientist; a retired diplomat to represent the Foreign Office; and in recent years one representative from the ethnic minorities &mdash; they have their amateurism in common.

This was an aspect of Blamey's work I had not appreciated, but a close inspection of his work reveals the carefully worked, overlapping planes created by the use of masking tape and palette knife. [/p] [p]
Blamey worked in oils, and his basic palette consists of titanium white, yellow ochre, burnt sienna, Indian red, cadmium red, cadmium yellow, ultramarine, occasionally cerulean, viridian blue black (a favourite colour) and occasionally alizarin crimson.
he is a slow and meticulous worker and will only complete three pictures a year.
Moreover, he only works on one picture at a time and only by natural daylight. [/p] [p]

On the telecommunications side, research is being carried out into high bandwidths that require high repetition pulses &mdash; a rate of 200GHz has been achieved and into Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers, which are a key component for future optical networks.
And, finally, work is continuing into the fabrication of fibres.
The researchers at Southampton use variants of the Modified Chemical Vapour deposition technique that was developed mainly in-house to produce a number of different types of fibres such as polarising, helical core and twin core, along with a range of single and multimode silica fibres for telecommunications, sensing and medical applications.
The University also says that it can supply state-of-the <head>art</head>fibre to other universities and industry across the world in accordance with specific designs, if required.

The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic; but as in this instance, for long it may be impossible to know the truth. [/p] [p]
One noticeable feature of American art life is the link between art historical teaching and criticism, not so common elsewhere.
The practice of American art historians reviewing or curating exhibitions, not only historical shows, is a normal feature of art life.
Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world, while the American market for current art is unprecedented; it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world.
The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of <head>art</head>to public collections also play a part, contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society.

Who would assert with confidence that there now are more professors with &bquo;data at their disposal&equo; than there were in 1918?
And of such professors, how many would rest content with the conclusion that Pound reached in 1918: &bquo;A critic must spend some of his time asking questions &mdash; which perhaps no one can answer.
It is much more his business to stir up curiosity than to insist on acceptances., Pound as critic cuts the critic down to size; which is, one may think, a pressing need, now, in 1984. [ptr][pb] [/p] [note]

If this exhibition means to report on the whole of twentieth-century American modernism then it has left out a great deal in the period between the two world wars; work that is historically important and good even though sometimes &bquo;provincial&equo; with respect to Europe.
With the exception of Ad Reinhardt there is no one who was involved in &bquo;pure&equo; or hard-edge abstraction in the Thirties; except for Hopper and Sheeler there is no realism before (or after) World War II; and there is no nod to Depression-era painting.
Massive chunks of history are missing and it is really not possible to understand the Abstract Expressionists without reference to how they incorporated or reacted against those earlier tendencies. [/p] [p]

The final room consists of a series of three roomsets from Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor.
These are laid out as though the Royal Family were in residence: an enormous jigsaw is barely started, a stuffed corgi lies beside a desk and, at Balmoral, a dog basket has its own heraldic blanket, while a headscarf is tossed on one side.
The comfortable chairs and sofa are covered in a shiny white chintz with purple thistle motifs.
This was, in fact, designed specially for Queen Victoria by Holland and Sons of London in 1855.

Then there was the freedom of the Voice of America, the freedom of the Free World.
By 1948 the US needed an international cultural prestige to offset its military and political power: it needed a sophisticated reply to the slogans of Yankee Go Home!
This is why the CIA during the 50s and 60s covertly supported a multitude of initiatives whose aim was to present the new American Art across the world as a promise for the future.

As the name implies, dendrochronology is specific to the dating of wood.
This technique is highly precise, to the year or even season of felling, if the sample is adequate.
Herein lies the problem: the wood needs to be of a [pb] species for which there is a &bquo;master chronology&equo; (see p. 125) and there must normally be at least a hundred tree rings in the sample to be dated to ensure a unique match with the master pattern.
If the date is to be precise to the year of felling, the bark must also be present, otherwise an estimate must be made of the number of missing rings corresponding to likely wastage by the carpenter.
Furthermore, to determine the date of actual usage, allowance must be made for seasoning of the timber. [/p] [p]
Dendrochronology is most commonly used in the <head>art</head>world to test the authenticity of panel paintings.

From high ground in the vicinity of the farm, there is a wide prospect of rolling moorlands backed by Gragareth across the shallow trench of Ease Gill: it is a desolate landscape, a wilderness devoid of trees and habitations and without any promise of beauty.
Most urban visitors will flee the scene and never return.
But appearances deceive.
This vast expanse of grass and heather is a cover concealing a realm of magic and mystery, where since the beginning of time nature has been at work slowly evolving an intricate subterranean labyrinth of caverns, grottoes and canals carved in beautiful designs by the agency of running water. [/p] [p]
This hidden wonderland, sculptured in darkness absolute, remained unseen and unsuspected through the ages until the present century when men first ventured into rifts in the ground and beheld in the light of torches an amazing display of sculptured limestone in patterns both incredibly delicate and massive, a living museum of <head>art</head>in many forms.

At each crisis point Lynagh has always kicked the goal, invariably from a difficult range or awkward angle, and dropped back into the groove. [/p] [p]
He is, of course, much more than the most prodigious goalkicker the international game has seen or is likely to see, given the reduction in the number of penalty offences.
A more rounded performer than Fox, Lynagh is the best fly-half in the world.
At the rate the Wallabies play test rugby, he may not take much more than another two years to reach the thousand.
He will by only 31 come the next World Cup. [/p] [p]
Unlike Hodgkinson, Lynagh and Fox have sustained their consistency over an infinitely longer period.
What Hodgkinson achieved in English terms was to elevate goalkicking to an <head>art</head>form with the metronomic [corr] rhythm [/corr] of his swing and the low trajectory, more often than not just enough to get the ball over the bar. [/p] [p]

Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction; in every period manuals on how to do it, whether drawing, making sculpture or other technical tasks are found, though their incidence is irregular, and such treatises are often the work of minor artists, rather than the great; Leonardo is an exception. [/p] [p]
Teachers of art are more likely to write books of instruction, and in their efforts to educate their students may make comments about the traditions they admire and from which they hope their students will learn.
One lesson for practical students is to analyse works.
A teacher's list for analysing pictures may be something like that of the American educationalist Thomas Munro: first impressions of the picture as a whole, line, light and dark, colour, mass, space, unity of design.
Books on <head>art</head>appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions, as they have done since the beginning of the century.

These achievements stem from the core aims which link with school values, concern for quality in education, and the merit of the &bquo;partnership&equo; notion, providing a framework for activity. [/p] [p]
All of this, and no mention of money or material resources!!
Our partnership has never been aimed at a resourcing of the school in a material sense, but has focused on the educational experiences of students and their provision at the highest quality possible.
Many of our partners work in industries where finance and resources are as hard to come by as they are in education.
This does not mean that such support is not available or forthcoming for genuine development.
Our work-experiences booklet is sponsored, materials for Technology and improvement of the school's environment have been supplied.
Sponsorship of an <head>Arts</head>Week and Events Week enabled both to take place, and the donation of physical resources is gratefully received.

I hope it will bring a few people along to the network who will stay for the music afterwards.&equo; [/p] [p]

The critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the clich&eacute; about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.
(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?
At least you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)
A requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic &mdash; one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic &mdash; is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here. [/p] [p]
There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.

The difficulties of the new professionally conscious architects of that time, when facing the judgement of enlightened amateurs, became a recurring situation during the campaign for new Government Offices.
The complexity of nineteenth-century building meant that increasing numbers of men had to devote their lives to its study, by making architecture their livelihood.
By establishing among themselves standards of attainment and behaviour, these largely middle-class experts aimed to seek social acceptability as professionals with a corporate identity. [/p] [p]
The first attempt to organize a professional body occurred in 1831, when the Architects Society was formed.
Until that time the Royal Academy of <head>Arts</head> , which was founded in 1768, was the only body in England with a substantial representation of architects among its membership, although they were always out-numbered by painters and sculptors.

He absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.
His major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.
His later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.
Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and <head>art</head>historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can &bquo;belong&equo; to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.

In short, Eliot has delineated a critic who recognizes public or civic responsibilities; and unless we are very careful, to say of this critic that he &bquo;serves his art&equo; may seem a rather sudden cramping and diminution of the claims made for him.
The same thing happens when, later in the essay, Eliot defines the limitation of Pound's kind of criticism (for &bquo;any kind of criticism has its limitations&equo;): &bquo;The limitation of Pound's kind is in its concentration upon the craft of letters, and of poetry especially&equo;.
To move from &bquo;<head>art</head> &equo; to &bquo;craft&equo; is rather plainly a further contraction, or diminution: and it will be radically misunderstood unless we remember that for Pound the level of craftsmanship (not just in letters, but in supposedly humbler trades also) is a register, a thermometer-reading, of the good or ill health of a period or of a society.

Saatchi, the most spectacular collector of recent times and probably the most active collector in British history (with the exception of King Charles I), had bought their work in greater bulk and more intelligently than any other individual or institution.
Now, as one New York dealer put it a week ago, &bquo;the word is that he's cashing in.&equo; [/p] [p]

In 1980 the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) was put on an independent footing, with what was then a large sum to spend on Britain's art and heritage.
All went well until 1985, when museum purchase grants were frozen at the level at which they have remained, the reasoning being that for anything really important, they could go to the NHMF.
This meant that museums not only became progressively poorer, but also less in control of their purchasing policies.
Then, only two months ago, Peter Brooke himself announced that they were to have no purchase grants as such, but that these were now merged with the vote which pays for running expenses.
The theory is that if museums save on salaries and paper clips they will have more money to spend on works of <head>art</head> ; the reality is that they will almost certainly be saving on the works of art to make up for inadequate funding overall.

Down the hill and past the Rotunda do Infante (roundabout with fountains) and the statue of Dom Henrique (Prince Henry the Navigator), we pass the Centro Comercial do Infante, which has a large variety of shops and restaurants.

On the right-hand side of the road (Avenida Arriaga) is the municipal theatre (Teatro Baltazar Dias).
It was opened in 1888, and inside it is reminiscent of the miniature theatre at Versailles.

In 1936, for example, the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions, on [hi]Cubist and Abstract Art [/hi], and [hi]Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism [/hi].
For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay, but it was Barr's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair.

His first sound film had been [hi]Hallelujah [/hi], which he had made for MGM in 1929.
Many subsequent critics have taken up the point made by radical blacks at the time that this was a romantic and pastoral view of the rural South, but several early critics hailed the film as a brilliantly realistic depiction of a whole section of American society.
Welford Beaton thought that its examination of the progress of cotton from field to factory would be of great educational value and he urged distributors to put the film into every motion-picture theatre in the world.
More realistically, though, he conceded that as beautiful as it was as screen <head>art</head>it nevertheless belonged to that category of films &bquo;which would not enrich their producers&equo;.

There is a vigorous defence of Coleman by Mayer: &bquo;The energies of Coleman's mind were more exclusively devoted to anything bearing upon the horse: and no wonder, for the College, constructed as it was and is, can only be adapted for the reception of that animal.
Consequently, it alone, of all our domesticated animals, has absorbed the whole attention, until very lately, of the professors of that establishment.
In Mr Coleman's early career, and even until within a very few years, the veterinary art, so far as regards its application to cattle, sheep, swine, dogs, etc., was in the lowest state of barbarism and degradation.

The outside painting was thoroughly carried out every seventh year, the two downstairs rooms &mdash; the front room and kitchen, every fourteen.
These may seem long periods but the work was so well done that the paintwork was never shabby.

When he has tovarisch say, &bquo;Nothing I build&equo;, this is to be understood not allegorically but literally: working of stone, either architecturally or sculpturally, was for Pound the register of culture &mdash; a conviction which he shared in his lifetime with few except the British art-critic whom he knew and esteemed, Adrian Stokes.
Thus the reference to the ruined walls of Eblis, in Aquitaine, is not gratuitous; and we know from other passages that Pound's refusal in the last resort to take seriously Russia's contribution to European culture was grounded in his notion that Russia had never produced an indigenous tradition of stone architecture.
On the other hand, when in the ruined court of Eblis the bees find &bquo;wild grass for their pleasure&equo;, that is good too.
For human building (<head>art</head> ) and the processes of germination (nature) are not in this vision opposed, as alternatives we must choose between.

The authorities may acquire any work of art that someone wants to export.
In such a case, the State will pay the owner the value he has established himself and presented to the Federal National Heritage Service or Custom Officers.
As an owner will have been interested in keeping the value low so as not to pay a high export premium, the State will be ideally placed to acquire valuable works of art on the cheap.
Nor will the State be forced to pay at once.
Payment can be postponed for a year and it is not clear yet how inflation will be taken into account and whether the price will be paid in roubles or in hard currency.

Such religious/humanitarian subject-matter &mdash; even the Holocaust, Hiroshima and Aids have not escaped &mdash; makes a fortress as unassailable by criticism as the art produced under tyranny.
The worth of individual pieces is, obviously, very various; consistent is the appeal to piety, ensuring that the elevated theme produces a warm-hearted response.
These composers are not coldly exploiting their audiences' kindness; they are all equally the victims of the going ideology.
And sincerity is not in question.
But the hard truth, nailed with all-time accuracy by the other great composer from Leningrad (the one who got out) is that sincerity does not guarantee quality.

THE SOPHISTICATED Miss Gertrude Jekyll, gardening heroine of the Edwardians, commissioned Edwin Lutyens to design her Surrey homestead, and this he did so beautifully that their relationship was cemented and many future joint commissions ensued.
The house was built by Thomas Underwood of Dunsfold, and the stonemason was William Herbert of Whitley.
The garden front, of Bargate stone, brick and tile, shows how Lutyens has exaggerated the local Surrey style to perfectly fitting proportions.
The roof lines swoop, the chimneys soar, and the beams of local oak in the hall look silver with age.
(This effect was achieved by spreading the timbers with hot lime for fifteen minutes and then scraping it off.)
Miss Jekyll's desire (with a little help) for all that was &bquo;thorough and honest of spirit of the good work of old days&equo;, the creed of the <head>Arts</head>and Crafts Movement, was fulfilled.

Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life, I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers, or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them, but that in time it is rejected, like an alien organ.

In this new show, he has shared curatorial responsibility with his old partner Christos Joachimides with whom he also worked on the German art show (1987, London and Stuttgart), and earlier, &bquo;A New Spirit in Painting&equo; (1980&ndash;81, Berlin and London).
The latter managed to sense the way the wind was to blow during the Eighties by anticipating the various forms of emerging Neo-Expressionism.
Their &bquo;Metropolis&equo; of 1991 on the other hand, also in Berlin, is generally thought not have succeeded in pointing the way for the decade, probably because the <head>art</head>scene is much more fragmented now and no single trend can be identified. [/p] [p]

(The courts finally decided that Indiana state law governed the purchase but examined Swiss law because important parts of the transaction had taken place in Switzerland). [/p] [p]
Furthermore article 939 of the Swiss civil code provides that if the purchaser is in bad faith, based on the test summarised above, the dispossessed owner can claim back his [corr] property [/corr] without any limitation in time. [/p] [p]
These comments do not intend to defend the idea that the existing rules cannot be improved (or that the Sevso case involved stolen goods), but merely that Swiss law should not be used as a &bquo;scapegoat&equo; in this field.
In practice the length of a statute of limitations is perhaps less significant than the content of the duty of diligence imposed upon purchasers of works of <head>art</head> .

Most obvious were the southern giant petrels: huge, dark brown birds, some with paler heads, and resembling an outsize fulmar, they glide ceaselessly to and fro along the waterfront on wings which can be up to two metres across.
Alert for scraps of anything edible, they congregate around the slaughterhouse or sewer outlets and they probably deserve their local name of &bquo;stinker&equo;!

It is always to be hoped that this charism will be active in popes and bishops, but it is not, nor can it be, reduced solely to their authority.
The more inclusive, &bquo;small m&equo; sense of magisterium has the main weight both of history and of Tradition behind it, and it is in this direction that the most vital movements in the Church &mdash; especially the increasing witness of women &mdash; are developing (cf.
Metz and Schillebeeckx, 1985). [/p] [p]
In the open intellectual milieu where Catholic exegetes and theologians now move among colleagues of other traditions of faith or of none, the traditional term &bquo;hermeneutics&equo; (the <head>art</head>and the principles of interpretation) has been taken over for a mode of philosophical discussion so technical that its products are usually baffling even to a well-educated reader.

Modigliani was in sympathy with the broad sentiments of the movement, the internationalism, the disgust at the war and those who profited from it, and the sensitivity to the new possibilities in art, although the emphasis on abstract art did not fit into his creed.
But at the time of the launch of Dada, Modigliani was not clear about the meaning of the new movement and no one else seemed to know.
&bquo;With psychological astuteness, the Dadaists spoke of energy and will and assured the world that they had amazing plans.
But concerning the nature of these plans, no information was forthcoming.&equo;
When the Dada brochure, [hi]Cabaret Voltaire [/hi], was published in June 1916 it was &bquo;a catch-all for the most diverse directions in <head>art</head>which at that time seemed to us to constitute &bquo;Dada&equo;.&equo;

In some ways sculptors became more adventurous, creating figures of larger scale and with more expansive poses than would have been tried in the first century.
But the delicacy of small-scale work, and the demands upon skill made by the need to join exactly the pieced works of the early Empire were diminished. [/p] [p]
The passion for Greece was by no means restricted to wealthy art collectors, antiquarians and professors of rhetoric.
The Roman Empire was itself more acceptable to provincial subjects than had been the case in the age of Augustus, and the emperor's taste for Greek art, well publicised by Hadrian's zest for provincial travel, therefore enjoyed wide support.
The broadly based Hadrianic Greek revival thus proved long lasting, and exerted a profound influence on the <head>art</head>of later antiquity.

In mounting this exhibition, the National Gallery is correcting a bias which it perceives in the content and popularity of the British collections and continuing its reassessment of Northern European art, already apparent from its recent acquisitions policy. [/p] [p]

The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction
proceeds above $100 million, people familiar with the transaction said.
But it's likely that Sotheby's will take a higher than usual commission,
called an override, on the amount exceeding the guarantee.  Sotheby's has
been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale.  At a news conference last
May announcing plans for the auction, Sotheby's estimated its value in
excess of $100 million.  More recently, Sotheby's has predicted the
collection will fetch $140 million.  That's the highest estimate for a
single collection in auction history.  The decision to put the entire
collection on the block stunned many, since Mr. Dorrance had served as

While the theme is compelling, the plot and characters are not.  We never
care about Said or the ``hypocrites'' he hunts.  ``The Thief and the Dogs''
is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic,
but it is likely to disappoint Western readers.  The 1981 novel ``Wedding
Song'' also is experimental, and another badly aimed bullet.  The story of
a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the
manner of Faulkner's ``The Sound and the Fury.'' But the device obscures
more than it illuminates.  Buried in the work is a meditation on the
morality of <head>art</head>, and on the struggle for integrity in an

Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been
arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of
Anthropology in Mexico City.  About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec
objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures,
were taken.  The government offered a reward for the return of the
antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery.  As it turned out,
Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a
closet in the Perches family's home for a year.  Then they took the art to
Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine.  Information from an

There is a simple reason for this: the Cuban people.  Let me immediately
put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate.  Those ``people''
to whom I refer are not some heroic, indecipherable quantity; they are
artists, critics, taxi drivers, grandmothers, even some employees of the
Ministry of Culture, all of whom share a deep belief in the original
principles of the Cuban Revolution, spelled out in terms such as equality
among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative
expression, universal rights to health and livelihood, housing, etc.  In
fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with
such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to
moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of

Consider as an example cases where a person (but only exceptionally an institution) is said to be an authority on a certain matter, as in &bquo;John is an authority on Chinese cooking&equo; or &bquo;Ruth is an authority on the stock exchange&equo;.
Neither John nor Ruth have authority over me, even though my Chinese cooking and my financial affairs will prosper if I follow their advice rather than trust my own judgment. [/p] [p]
One may say that to be an authority on a certain matter is to be an authority about what to believe rather than about what to do.
While generally true this does not solve the difficulty in the case of John and Ruth since each of them may claim to be both a theoretical and a practical authority.
They do not have <head>authority</head>over me because the right way to treat their advice depends on my goals.

It was in the years between the First and Second World Wars that this enthusiasm was at its height.
The faithful elucidated the mysteries of Indirect Rule with the theological rapture of early Christians disclosing to themselves the nature of the Trinity.
Critics [pb] raised their voices with the consciousness of challenging a ruling orthodoxy.
All sorts and conditions of native societies were declared to be suitable candidates for it, even when they possessed, to Western eyes, no discernible political organization at all, and so no evident agency through which indirection might be achieved.

For example, the managers in most authorities trust their clinical staff to be applying the most appropriate treatment technologies, either in their day-to-day practice, or in submitting bids for the development of clinical services.
The extent to which this trust is misplaced is unknown.
Managers mainly comfort themselves in the knowledge that physical and financial resources for clinical work are in short supply in the NHS.
This is therefore likely to encourage clinicians to search for more cost-effective procedures.
However, it is known from the research into performance indicators that clinical teams with similar levels of resources produce different amounts of services (Yates &amp; Davidge, 1984).
Also it is conceivable that cash limits, whilst being effective in capping overall expenditure, may militate against the adoption of new, cost-effective, procedures if these necessitate financial outlays. [/p] [p]

It was noticeable that the libraries who listed a substantial number of local authority courses were often the ones who listed substantial numbers of internal and external courses as well, so that there was a strong relationship between total number of courses and involvement of local authority ( [hi]see [/hi] Table 24).
Furthermore, commitment of such central training resources to libraries often went hand-in-hand with commitment of library management time to training, presumably because to an extent both are aspects of the same overall policy of the parent authority towards training.

Firstly, on the narrow ground that the word &bquo;premises&equo; in s.91 of the 1875 Act (now replaced by s.92 of the Public Health Act 1936) does not include sewage disposal works.
Secondly, on the broader ground that the legislature could not have intended to give power to a court of summary jurisdiction to control nuisances from such works. [pb] [/p] [p]

Nevertheless, Anselm believed it to be well founded, and he certainly went further than Lanfranc, and was stiffer than Rufus and Henry I, in refusing to acknowledge any papal legate other than himself in England. [/p] [p]
I have already mentioned Anselm's firm refusal to confer about the discipline of the English Church with the papal legate who brought his pallium.
On that occasion he had a special reason &mdash; though an odd one &mdash; for his refusal: he was fully occupied with the duty of defence which had been entrusted to him by the king.
Nevertheless, he also clearly implied that it was none of the legate's business.
Beyond the immediate circumstances of this case, Anselm rejected, so far as England was concerned, the recent papal [pb] practice of entrusting to specially appointed legates large areas within which they had <head>authority</head>over all archbishops and bishops.

A friend of mine, a policeman, once stopped a huge wrestler late at night.
In fact the wrestler was a well-known stuntman.
He was absolutely colossal &mdash; about 5 foot 10 inches tall and 6 foot wide, and carrying a riding crop covered from end to end with thick black tape.

The preponderance of directly managed units in the new arrangements could affect the remit of authorities in another way.

These studies show us that many of the families who successfully parent hard to place children are not conventional, middle-class, two-child families.
They sometimes have unusual parenting styles and some, though by no means all, find that having a social worker looking over their shoulder makes them feel uncomfortable and unnecessarily unsure of themselves.
It is up to social workers and the legal system to find ways of supporting rather than hindering parents and children in the difficult task of building themselves into a new family.
This does, I believe, mean that a rethink is urgently needed about the boarding-out regulations, reviews and some other aspects of social work practice, which are appropriate to social work with permanent new families.
Essentially it is about increasing the <head>authority</head>of the new family and playing down the authority role of the social worker. [/p] [p]

The procedural consequence of the doctrine of corporate legal personality is that the proper plaintiff in any action against the directors for breach of their duties is the company, not individual shareholders.
This raises very complicated questions, as yet not fully resolved by the courts, as to the extent to which a director who holds shares may take off his director's hat and attempt to ratify as a shareholder his own alleged misconduct.
The old case authorities suggest that the nature of a share as property does not prevent such a course, but the more modern cases seem to incline towards some restrictions upon the use of votes where there is a conflict of interest involved. [/p] [p]

Turning to the relevance of consent to the obligation to obey the law, we will here be concerned not with the well-known problem that most citizens in any given society have not consented to the authority of their government, but with the prior question whether their consent, if given, would have been valid.
The main lesson of the discussion of the previous section is that judgment on the validity of consent has to be discriminating.
Consent may be valid in certain contexts or subject to certain conditions and invalid in other contexts and or when the conditions are not met.
From the fact that in some circumstances consent is valid, it does not follow that consent to the government's authority is valid.
One has to examine closely what arguments can establish the validity of such consent. [/p] [p]
Doubts about the validity of consent to political <head>authority</head>are sometimes expressed on the ground that citizens have no choice but to consent.

The specifications of November 1939 became a reality just 43 years ago, when a CW pump evacuated model with sealing wax joints was switched on for the first time at the end of February 1940, and operated successfully.
Visible streams of what turned out to be high frequency radiation flowed from the output lead and burnt out all the de-capped car headlamps we could find!
A little later we used a Lecher-wire system to determine the wavelength at 9.8 cm.
From then on, development of the magnetron became a cooperative effort between university and industry in the UK: E. C. S. Megaw of the Research Laboratories of the GEC was let into the secret and went back to Wembley to construct the first sealed-off model.

DURING his most recent visit to his native Poland in 1987, crowds chanting &bquo;Down with communism&equo; greeted Pope John Paul II.
Since then, communism has fallen, and his once-faithful compatriots will no longer welcome him with the same fervour when he arrives for his fourth visit on June 1st.
He may even meet some Poles who demonstrate against him.
While nine Poles in ten call themselves Roman Catholics, they are discovering, with the help of a free press, that they disagree, sometimes violently, over the Catholic church's role in their public life and private morality. [/p] [p]
It may come as a shock.
That the end of communism could also prove to be the end of the Catholic church's unquestioned moral <head>authority</head>in Poland was the last thing the church hierarchy expected when the Solidarity leader, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, himself a long-time Catholic activist, became the first non-communist prime minister in 1989.

In [hi]The Parable of the Wicked Mammon [/hi] he compared the cardinals and bishops with the Scribes and Pharisees.
Much of the book was devoted to exposition of the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith.
It was condemned by the English bishops, who found twenty-nine heretical propositions in it.

I should not yield to theirs unless I see its point and come to agree with them.
Here the normal justification thesis establishes the credentials of John and Ruth as authorities in their fields.
But whether or not there is a complete justification for me to regard their advice or instructions as guides to my conduct in the way I regard a binding authoritative directive depends on my other goals.
In such cases while talking of a person as being an authority one refrains from talking of him as in authority over oneself, and avoids regarding his advice or instructions as binding, even when, given one's goals, one ought to treat it in exactly the same way as one treats a binding authoritative directive.

In fact it seems to this reviewer that Quinton's framework offers essential support for Eccleshall's vision of Conservatism, in that the axioms Quinton describes provide for a specifically Conservative conception of political authority and social discipline. [/p] [p]
If one accepts that Quinton offers a more comprehensive formulation of Conservatism than Eccleshall, then Thatcherism's credentials must be checked again.
Eccleshall himself implicitly acknowledges this problem, for he notes at one point that Thatcherism's characteristics &mdash; &bquo;its mixture of abrasively theoretical market economics, uncompromising anti-egalitarianism and fervent patriotism&equo; &mdash; are hardly &bquo;the ingredients of what Oakeshottians judge to be authentic Conservatism&equo;.

It has been estimated that as many as 10% of old people admitted to hospital are there as a direct result of drugs prescribed by their GP (Age Concern, 1977), and Phillipson (1982) suggests that much over-prescription of drugs is a conscious attempt to control the medical demands on the health service by older people. [/p] [p]
Complete reliance upon medical professionals can therefore be dangerous.

As the York writer noted, the king did not love Anselm after he had thwarted him in the matter of investitures.
Henceforth he supported York until Anselm's death brought him back to his father's policy of supporting the unity of the Church under the southern see, By this time, however, it was too late to alter the general swing away from overlordships such as that claimed by Canterbury.
If anything permanent were to be achieved, it should have been done under Rufus.
Probably even by that time the whole policy was out of date; but it did not seem so to the monks of Canterbury, nor to Anselm himself. [/p] [p]

Christian teachings are expressions of the religious awareness in its Christian form.
They can only be understood, and their truth can only be measured, by reference back to that awareness.
To treat them simply as statements of objective fact, to be proved or disproved by appeal to observation of the world around us, to the speculations and arguments of metaphysical philosophy, or even to the authority of the Bible understood as a collection of &bquo;divine truths&equo;, is to misconceive their nature and function.
To say, for example, that God is the Creator and Preserver of the world, is to give particular expression to the awareness of absolute dependence; and it is in and through that awareness that the meaning and truth alike of the doctrinal affirmation are opened up.

But the eternal and temporal worlds met in the maintenance of rights given to the saints and committed to his guardianship.

But by this time the Crown was assessing the royal forests, not so much as hunting preserves but as sources of timber, especially for ship-building.
As early as 1483 an Act had been passed, legalizing the enclosure of coppices in the forests where felling had taken place, until seedling beech and oak had grown again.
New officers had to be appointed for the new objective of woodland management for timber production.
So in 1547 Henry VIII decreed the appointment of two Masters and two Surveyors of the Woods, one each for either side of the Trent, as officers of the Court of Augmentations.
After the Court was absorbed in the Exchequer in 1554, that part of the Crown revenues was managed by &bquo;Surveyors-General of Woods, Forests, Parks and Chases&equo;, responsible to the Exchequer.

This strategy has attempted to moderate expenditure while disposing of public assets.
It has not been a wholly successful policy.
In the mid-1980s, many local councils substantially overspent their cash limits.
This was due to a number of practices, including the willingness of local authorities to pre-fund or defer expenditure, and to enter into various lease-back arrangements with developers and/or funding institutions.
However, this should not hide the fact that many, especially urban, councils have capital resources that are inadequate to deal with the problems that face them.
The repair bill for public-sector accommodation is estimated to be at least &pound;20 billion in 1986 prices (Association of Metropolitan <head>Authorities</head> , 1986), a year in which total capital spending amounted to about &pound;5.5 billion. [/p] [p]

Ministers also hoped that employers would cut out overmanning and root out inefficiency, even if this led to a temporary surge in unemployment.

The advocates of the Government's &bquo;competing currencies&equo; approach suggest that many of these gains would occur by merely moving to a &bquo;hard&equo; EMS in which currencies became progressively more fixed (3).
However, the evidence so far suggests that it is not enough to persuade businesspeople that rates will really be fixed forever.
Moreover, the process of establishing credibility is long drawn out.
The French, despite an exceptionally tough policy, still have interest rates above the German level because they are unable to persuade the markets they mean what they say when they rule out a devaluation. [/p] [p]

One of the themes running through [hi]The State of the Prisons [/hi] is that with a few exceptions, neither numbers nor conditions of prisoners have changed very much since Howard first visited. [/p] [p]
The ratio of prisoners, primarily adult males, to the population of Texas as a whole has usually been high, and higher than for most other American states.
Prisons are big business in Texas.
There can be few jurisdictions where the location of a major university programme was determined by the location of the oldest prison. [/p] [p]
The prison population now stands at around 40,000, which was that of England and Wales prior to the 1980s increase, against a total state population of rather more than half that of England and Wales.
In keeping with the tradition of doing things in a big way, the Texas <head>authorities</head>have always built large prisons.

In his speech he went out of his way to welcome the establishment of the Faculty, and the part it would play in encouraging and enhancing proficiency and knowledge of tax not only within the profession, but in business, industry and commerce, and among the general public the profession serves.
He thanked the Institute and the Tax Committee &mdash; now the Faculty's technical committee &mdash; for their positive and constructive role in the development of the tax system over the years and for the thought and effort put into representations. [/p] [p]

For Holzner the process of socialization is important for &bquo;orienting&equo; the individual but so is the perception of consensus and, in times of crisis, [pb] the authority of a charismatic leader.
He also gives some emphasis to channels of communication and their control; the flow of information that is interpreted by individuals according to their frame of reference. [/p] [p]
Holzner goes further than Berger and Luckmann by describing two &bquo;foci of reality construction&equo; beyond that of everyday life &mdash; specialized knowledge and ideological knowledge.
The former are organized around the activities of work that give individuals and work communities a specialized knowledge not available or necessary in everyday fife.

The instrumental value of consent to the authority of just governments is to be seen as reinforcing other moral motives to support just institutions where those may fail due to human ignorance or weakness.
Consent may produce the results that belief in other reasons should but may fail to produce.
This is particularly valuable in the case of government officials.
Their power to affect the public and the importance of public confidence in their loyalty give special importance to their fidelity to justified authority.
Hence reinforcing this fidelity by consent is a valuable common practice in many countries.
Consent, duly qualified, can play a subordinate but none the less valuable role in reinforcing independent obligations. [/p] [p]
Against this undoubted benefit one has to set the likely bad consequences of recognizing the general and unqualified validity of consent to political <head>authority</head> .

Are political authorities to be equated with big Daddy who knows best?
Second, again the suspicion must creep back that the exclusive concentration on the individual blinds one to the real business of government, which is to co-ordinate and control large populations. [/p] [p]
These doubts stem from a failure to appreciate the many ways in which the communal character of political authorities affects their claim to legitimacy [hi]vis-a-vis [/hi] each individual.
Let us examine some of these points in brief.
The fact that political authorities rule over whole communities itself dictates some of the ways in which the question of the justification of such authorities should be formulated.

The Elton Committee felt that teachers' authority in this country would be better protected by setting out the fundamental principles governing that authority in statute.
They viewed the law as providing a basis for the teacher's authority to exert discipline within the school, but lamented the fact that the legal limits were derived from a collection of diverse sources, more especially case law or precedent under common law.
The Report says that &bquo;If, as we believe, society wants teachers to have effective authority over pupils, it should make the basis and nature of that authority clear in statute&equo;.

The armies varied in style; whilst the Saxon thegns rode horses, they invariably fought on foot, with axes, and the defensive position forced relative immobility on their troops, with the central professional nucleus, the [hi]housecarls [/hi], surrounding the king.
The Normans, by comparison, were led by armoured and fairly mobile knights, backed by a barrage of archers and organised groups of spear and swordsmen. [/p] [p]
The battle took place on a Saturday, 14 October: because the armies were so evenly matched and the ground so difficult it lasted eight hours, a great time in a world where a decision was usually reached in just over two hours.
The Bayeux tapestry gives a magnificent cartoon report of the action, but it needs to be seen as a piece of victorious Norman propaganda; it is to be doubted that the English spent the previous night in carousing whilst the Normans engaged in earnest prayer.

Although the Central Authority initially resisted the more direct encroachment of Whitehall on the Area Boards (successfully insisting that communication should normally be through the Authority), the semi-political process which determined the Whitehall allocation of resources to electricity was mirrored within the British Electricity Authority.
The division of power and cash between the Authority itself (responsible for generation) and the Area Boards (responsible for distribution) was subject to a complex process of bargaining not only with the Ministry but also internally, with discussion there directed as much to political, consensual ends as to traditional commercial disciplines.
This was pre-eminently the case where the Area Boards were united in opposing the Central <head>Authority</head>or the Government (as on the Clow differential), though Citrine was more willing to give in to such pressure on matters where he respected the Board Chairmen's views, such as tariffs, than on matters where he was determined to impose his own, as in labour relations.

Today Mudge's views read like a classic case study of most elements of nineteenth-century racism.

Alongside the new universities themselves, starting their degree courses from scratch and employing large numbers of sometimes rather dubiously qualified new lecturers, there was a parallel development in the polytechnics, many of them offering degree courses for the first time, and devising courses in subjects such as literature, languages, and philosophy that had nothing whatever to do with the technology-based courses for which they had first been invented.
All this local authority-financed expansion was subject to the liberal, though very thorough, validation procedures of the newly invented Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA).
The Council was charged with the task of seeing that the new courses were of degree standard, but was powerless to adjudicate on the wisdom or otherwise of there being so many arts-orientated courses in the first place.
It seemed in truth a time of indulgent expansion; and, as if in retribution, students of all kinds, in universities old and new and in the polytechnics, became more and more resistant to <head>authority</head> , not just social authority, but the academic authority of their teachers and of the disciplines within which they were studying.

In Europe the three current structures that are probably most used are the Dutch company with a Swiss branch, the Belgian co-ordination centre and &mdash; a relative newcomer &mdash; the Irish Dublin Docks company. [/p] [p]
Although occasionally Dutch finance companies with Antillean parents (taxed at a turn on the interest in the Netherlands) are still seen, for the past few years the perceived wisdom has been that the Swiss finance branch structure is superior.
This structure rests on the Dutch/Swiss treaty, under which income arising in the branch is basically 90% exempted from tax in the Netherlands.
Simultaneously, the Swiss cantonal <head>authorities</head>treat a large proportion of the branch capital as a loan from head office and give a deemed deduction for interest thus greatly reducing the actual Swiss taxable profit without affecting the treaty allocation mentioned above.

The documents of the Second Vatican Council have provided the Catholic Church with what is undoubtedly the weightiest body of official teaching in the twentieth century.
However, although the Council said an awful lot, much of it was rather long-winded; moreover, it avoided solemn definitions and almost avoided direct condemnations.
Its teaching is not &mdash; at least for the most part &mdash; either definitive or exclusive of error.
Nevertheless, the <head>authority</head>of an ecumenical Council, more representative of the whole world than any previous Council, working responsibly and prayerfully across four years with all the support it could get from the ablest theologians, is clearly in human and ecclesial terms as considerable as can be.

In Kufra, in 1979, some people did not pay their contribution to the small boy who visited the houses, so their shaikh went in person.
They explained that they were poor and that the sick man was rich and could afford to stay in bed without working.
Rather than arguing that lineage solidarity demanded their contribution, or that he had decided and his decision bound them, the shaikh pooh-poohed their claim of poverty, and disputed the invalid's alleged wealth.
He presented himself as organizer of reciprocities (&bquo;Am I to ask them for a dinar when you are sick?&equo;) rather than as lineage banker: he noticeably did not raise issues of authority.
Although differences in wealth were a potential threat to lineage welfare systems the recusants on this occasion did not want to challenge the shaikh's [pb] <head>authority</head> , at least not on these grounds, and after half an hour's discussion they paid up.

LEAs are empowered to take such steps as they consider are necessary to prevent the breakdown or continuing breakdown of discipline at a school, a power which the Elton Committee urges them to invoke when the situation warrants it.

The abbot of F&eacute;camp put the same question to Ivo of Chartres, who produced the text of Pope Hyginus, misquoted by Anselm but available in the Canon Law collection of Burchard of Worms.
It supported Anselm's conclusion.
So, after travelling half round Christendom, this small problem finally had an acceptable solution, and Anselm had been right after all, against the views of both pope and Curia. [/p] [p]
The difficulty experienced by the abbot of F&eacute;camp in getting a decision on this small point has both a general and a particular interest.
In general, it illustrates the amateurish state of government at this time: there were as yet no doctors of Canon Law, no schools in which the subject was studied, no lectures, no centres of expert knowledge.
It is indeed strange that Anselm never referred the question to Ivo, bishop of Chartres: he knew him as a friend, but not apparently as the greatest <head>authority</head>on Canon Law in northern Europe.

Poll tax officers and water authorities will have direct powers of debt recovery after April, increasing pressure on tenants to pay their rent bill last of all.

The 1962 Hospital Plan (MoH, 1962) and the 1971 Formula (DHSS, 1970) did attempt to reduce these inequalities at the regional level, but the evidence indicated that inequalities within regions exceeded those between regions (Cooper and Culyer, 1970).
Prior to 1974, however, planning health care and equalising resources below the regional level was difficult, due largely to the absence, in the hospital sector, of a geographically based planning and management tier below the level of the region.
The pre-1974 sub-regional tier, the Hospital Management Committee (HMC), was responsible for running a hospital or a [pb] group of hospitals and rarely had specific responsibilities to ensure that the needs of a defined population were met. [/p] [p]
New opportunities for sub-regional planning came with the establishment in 1974 of Area Health <head>Authorities</head>(AHAs) &bquo;with full planning and operational responsibilities&hellip; responsible for the provision of comprehensive health services&hellip;&equo; to a defined population (DHSS, 1972).

The aim was to join Croatian and Serbian Serbs in a Greater Serbia. [/p] [p]
The independence of Croatia and Slovenia left Bosnians a terrible choice: staying with Serbia and Montenegro or declaring an independent state, sovereign and recognised but unable to defend itself.
Freed from duty in Croatia by the peace of January 1992, federal troops were soon being redeployed in Bosnia as part of the Serb forces there, under General Radko Mladic. [/p] [p]

Agriculture had been in steady decline since the 1870s, and after a brief post-war boom was to sink back into it again in the 1930s.
Two centuries after the &bquo;blowing&equo; of the Denver sluice in 1713, the whole security of the south level of the Fens depended solely upon the security of the restored sluice.

It cannot be described as a student-led movement, starting as it did on a wall located on a busy shopping street, rather than on one of the capital's many campuses.
&bquo;Democracy Wall&equo; immediately attracted a wide cross-section of people.
Many of the poster writers were former students, the older generation of educated youth who had returned from the countryside.
They criticised the leaders who had deprived them of proper schooling and their adolescent years.
Left to languish on the farms, elements of &bquo;rusticated&equo; youth had returned illegally to the cities, without the necessary residence permits (hukou).

Some of the sexism feminists have identified in (English) usage is of an &bquo;everyday&equo; type &mdash; for example, conventions for addressing women and vocabulary available to insult them.
This kind of sexism can be (and has been) noted, but it is hard to get rid of because it occurs in &bquo;unregulated&equo; contexts: nobody has made or written down a rule saying that women can be addressed as &bquo;dearie&equo; or referred to as &bquo;bitches&equo;.
In these cases, analysis may have to suffice, or feminists may have to be content with informal, guerilla-style resistance. [/p] [p]

Though after the Lateran Pact of 1929, which settled the conflict between the Holy See and Italy, the Bishop of Rome was no longer a (self-imposed) &bquo;prisoner in the Vatican&equo;, the papacy's isolation remained, heightened in popular consciousness by the war years.
His readiness to speak on almost any topic, and especially on medical ethics, was remarkable: his speeches averaged out over the pontificate at almost one a day.
Though (except for the definition of the bodily Assumption of Mary in November 1950) none of these declarations fell into the formal category of infallible as defined at Vatican I, none the less Catholics came to expect authoritative guidance from Rome on all manner of issues &mdash; a strong tendency within the Church down to the present day.

From this point of view, which could make no place for miracles understood as cases of divine, supernatural interference with the laws of nature, reports of alleged miracles could only be regarded as evidence of credulity and ignorance on the part of those who originated and passed on the stories.
The Bible's miracles, so far from supporting its claim to supernatural authority, served rather to undermine its credibility.
So the same kind of stark opposition grew up between orthodoxy and rationalism on the matter of miracles as on the authority of the Bible; and the issues raised then have surfaced again in a number of forms since. [/p] [p]
Before we move on, it is worth noticing that just as the debate about the Bible rested to a large extent on a rather dubious notion of what kind of <head>authority</head>was in question, so too the argument about miracles was one in which both sides generally shared an equally questionable concept.

Even so it may be that regarding each individual, he is less likely successfully to follow right reasons which apply to him anyway if left to himself than if he always obeys the directives of a just government including those which are morally reprehensible. [/p] [p]
Can it be that governments have in such circumstances authority to pass immoral and unjust laws?
The reason this conclusion is objectionable is because the locution &bquo;X has authority to pass laws of kind X&equo; indicates in most contexts that X has the authority to issue such laws in order to use it to make such laws.
That is, it implies that part of the reason for his authority is that it be used in this way.
Clearly it is not part of the reason for any government's authority that it should pass unjust or immoral laws.

There [pb] was very little sign in this report of constructive planning to use social work skills to support old people and their carers. [/p] [p]
The constraint for social workers wanting to do family work with elderly clients is to be allowed the time to do it at all.
A way forward indicated in the Wagner Report (1988, p. 3.6) identified a role for a nominated social worker.
This builds on the work of the Kent Community Care Project.
The key worker or case manager role, identified in the research, uses social work time productively to help maintain a vulnerable person in his/her home, and not using more costly residential care.
This requires understanding by manager and social worker alike (Davies and Challis, 1986).

At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 %
of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings.  When two parties
engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on
future rates.  Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest
payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate
payments.  In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed
to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate
payments.  As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than
the banks were paying them.  The court hearing began in early October at
the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued

production.  ``If we wanted to stage ` Death of a Salesman, '``Mr. Sagan

It's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the

and approximately $1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the

sell-off that occurred Oct. 13, it ended Friday at about 8 11\/16 %.  James
Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, is touting
shorter-term securities, which he says should benefit more quickly than
longer-term bonds as interest rates fall.  ``Given our forecast for lower
rates, purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end,''
he said.  Mr. Kochan also likes long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds
and long-term Treasurys.  He says these bonds should appreciate in value as
some investors, reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield

The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a

proposed legislation has a laudable goal: to assure the integrity of the

proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the
system it sets out to preserve.  The complex bill, introduced by Sens.

covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and

So, first time through you take the &bquo;first time bar&equo; (ie. bar 8) and return to start back at bar 1 again.
The second time through you miss out the first time bar (8) and take the second time bar (9) and continue on with bars 10, 11 etc. [/p] [p]

In short, theology is no longer simply taken for granted or even accepted by society at large.
This is a situation of which modern theologians have been well aware &mdash; often too much so for the comfort of many in the churches &mdash; and with which they have tried in various ways to deal. [/p] [p]
Within that wider development, the credibility of Christian faith itself first came to be seriously challenged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries &mdash; in what is commonly called the [hi]Age of Reason [/hi] or the [hi]Enlightenment [/hi].
The chief mark of that period was a new confidence in the power of reason, as opposed to acceptance of authority, to discover truth: we find things out, not simply by believing what someone else tells us, but by considering the evidence, reflecting upon it, and accepting what can &bquo;prove itself at the <head>bar</head> of reason&equo;.

John has been brought to the bar, &bquo;a paradise for bachelors&equo;, by his randy friend Ernest (played by Dustin's real friend Stanley Beck).
She goes back to his four-room bachelor apartment at 52 Riverside Drive.
They go to bed as strangers and then spend the weekend alternately insulting each other and making up, trying to find out if they are fond of each other.
We learn with them that he designs furniture (as Harry Hoffman did) and she works in a gallery of primitive art on Madison Avenue, but only in the end do they reveal their names to each other.
When they first meet at the bar, he says to her, &bquo;What did you say your name was?&equo; 'I didn't say.

But they are interrupted and they do not bother to ask the question again during the whole weekend.

Having agreed that this was a good idea, David and I went down to a pub called The Three Tuns, which is in Beckenham High Street.

Thus walls were often covered with, and the bar partitions made of, tongue-and-groove boarding, which was often grained.
Floors were frequently made from bare wooden boards or stone slab.
The exception was in the treatment of the bar itself, which was often treated as a decorative eyecatcher. [/p] [p]
This approach to design could formerly be seen in the Public Bar of the White Swan, Bradford Street, Deritend, Birmingham (owned by Allied's Ansells division).
This 1900 pub has a tongue-and-groove dado, about which the walls are covered with glazed tiles.
The focus of the design was the decorative bar and its back display area, whose strong lighting made it the centrepiece of the pub.
This concept has, however, been ruined by the introduction of a <head>bar</head> overhang with secondary lighting which obscure views of the back-bar display.

Retiring tenants sell their tenancy to a purchaser who must be approved by the company: applications are handled by Estates, usually by Mike Lester personally.
As is customary in the trade, tenants purchase all fixtures and fittings (including bar furnishings), initially from the company and subsequently from the outgoing tenant.
Goodwill is specifically excluded from the selling price (again, this is customary in the trade).
The price is invariably agreed on the basis of figures submitted by an independent licensed property valuer.
The price at which tenancies change hands is currently within the range &pound;115,000 to &pound;155,000. [/p] [p]
Tenants are required to purchase all liquor, soft drinks and <head>bar</head> items such as crisps and tobacco from Palatine, though at a discount, and they are expected to make their living from the profits after deduction of rent (paid to Palatine), wages, rates, lighting and heating, etc.

The second time through you miss out the first time <head>bar</head> (8) and take the second time bar (9) and continue on with bars 10, 11 etc. [/p] [p]

I did not even complain to the British Medical Association &mdash; as I was in law entitled so to do &mdash; about the gross impertinence of a certain toothy and incompetent doctor in this very borough who imagined in his stupidity that I was incapable of reading upside-down the notes he was making on the other side of a desk at which I was once unwise enough to sit.
I do not make a fuss, I do not rant and splutter.
I simply remove myself, calmly, and with a dignity that must be noticed even by those who would have to look the word up in a dictionary to get some faint glimmer of an idea of what the concept actually means. [/p] [p]
But a distaste for gossip should not be construed as a total reluctance to express the truth about another person's behaviour when no possible alternative exists as a way of defending myself.

HOUSEWIFE Sarah Fox's dream of making a fortune from soap that FLOATS has disappeared down the plughole. [/p] [p]

But, sadly, nobody appears interested.&equo; [/p] [p]

He'd use it to identify and locate all the landmarks which he had stared up at during his exhausting explorations, now seen from a very different perspective; he knew the names of all the streets where the distant, anonymous towers of the banks and finance companies were sited, having worn himself out many times by walking along them, fascinated by the scenes glimpsed behind their mirrored, darkened or tinted glass windows and walls.
Now he'd sit and stare at those same walls made transparent by all the lights left on at night.
From his local library he got photocopies of the maps of his district for 1811, 1843 and 1871; he'd sit there and try to work out how the changes in the maps related to the view at night; where the darkness of rookeries, courts and tenements had been replaced with the darkness of lampless parks and public gardens.
He worked out where The <head>Bar</head> was on his maps, and then checked this perspective against the actual view &mdash; from where he saw the city it looked like The Bar was right in the middle of it, not hidden away at all like it was on the map.

Miss Roybal-Allard argues that a lawyer who is sleeping with a divorce client may not try too hard to reconcile husband and wife. [/p] [p]
The state bar would prefer to set a blanket rule governing all types of lawyers.
It has argued that a total ban on sex may be unnecessary; it would prefer to have rules that prevent a lawyer from bullying a client to have sex.
The Los Angeles bar &mdash; home to 26,000 lawyers &mdash; reckons that its existing rules, which &bquo;prohibit sexual relations with a client when such relations would impair the parties' decision-making abilities&equo;, are sufficient.

Siobhan Redmond I'd seen once in a revue by Marcella for St Andrews University and I tracked her down in Glasgow and asked her would she like to do a show for buttons for the newly opened Tron Theatre, who were interested.
She said yes.
Esther Allan dusted off the music and taught her the best songs from [hi]Sugar and Spite [/hi].
We both thought Siobhan was brilliant.
This inspired me to write the dreadful Verena for her.
(Siobhan provided the &bquo;basically&equo; Verena threaded things together with.)
&bquo;Suzanne Valadon&equo; was rescued from the [hi]Goodstyle [/hi] script and its patchy Franglais with Frenchy music by Esther was something Siobhan made all her own.
Some things were revived and rewritten from [hi]Sugar and Spite [/hi] but Esther and I both wrote like maniacs, together, separately, new stuff. [/p] [p]

Naturally, such visits can allow only the most superficial understanding of prison life, any conversations with prisoners and warders being cursory and inhibited by the presence of a senior officer.
Nevertheless, the staff were open and co-operative and I found the visit productive, gleaning more information and obtaining clearer impressions than I originally expected.
Inevitably, I saw the prison through the eyes of a western visitor, but after three months in India I had acquired at least a superficial understanding of the country and its penal philosophy. [/p] [p]
The gaol was situated not far from the centre of a large and fast-growing industrial town.
Built around the turn of the century, it had been designed originally as a soldiers' barracks.

The code number is read into the computer, and then the text string for that number is read from the computer's data base.
Without this massive data base, all you read in from the bar code is a meaningless number. [/p] [p]
This is a good way of doing things in that it enables what is effectively a limitless number of different codes to be used, with as little or as much data as desired being attached to each code.
The data associated with each code number can be as small as the price such as &bquo;38p&equo;, or 100,000 words of text.
The upper limit on the amount of data is set by the database that has to handle it all, rather than by the car code system. [/p] [p]
The system is less satisfactory in that you can only extract meaningful information from a <head>bar</head> code if you have a computer equipped with a suitable decoding system and database.

It was decided to build a huge central market, the construction of which was entrusted to Baltard, a man who was as much an engineer as an architect, on a site which had existed since the reign of Napoleon I. Succeeding regimes had neither had the will nor the drive to carry out the project as originally planned, but the Emperor was determined that this new market should be one of the earliest major building projects of his reign.
He indicated to Haussmann that the form of the railway station, a huge open space covered by glass, had impressed him as a possible model and as a result of the Emperor's predilections, and Baltard's skill, the great new market of Les Halles was built in a light, airy combination of iron, stone and glass.
Its ten pavilions were to serve Paris for over a century and to take their place in the city's folklore.
From its inception, the new market was gas-lit, thus permitting night-time operations, so that the area became one of nocturnal rendez-vous &mdash; its caf&eacute;s and <head>bars</head> open when all else was closed.

The plans would seem to have the merit both of broadening the spectrum of judges and giving the consumer greater choice. [/p] [p]
Almost to a man, barristers fought the scheme.
Some of their arguments, such as that their professional standards were higher than could be maintained by law &mdash; as envisaged in the legislation &mdash; had a ring of truth to them.
But there was an unmistakable whiff of vested interest about the howls of outrage.
They had a considerable army of former lawyers to call upon in parliament, and the comments of the former lord chancellor, Lord Hailsham, that the Government was &bquo;thinking with its bottom and sitting on its head&equo; caused a flurry or two.
In the end, the hapless Lord Mackay's proposals were considerably watered down.

There is no evidence that zinc metal was ever prepared in Africa &mdash; it has to be made by condensation since it volatilises before it can be reduced from the ore.

Brass made from metallic zinc was patented in England in [/p] [p]
1781 so Benin alloys exceeding 30 per cent of zinc must be later than this date. [/p] [p]
There is plenty of documentary evidence that brass objects were imported into Benin from Europe by sea and no one doubts that this was the main source of the metal from the 16th century onwards.
In earlier periods, some metal was traded across the Sahara Desert.

The Frenchwoman who was the major politician of the 1550s was therefore deeply in tune with two centuries of Scottish political tradition.
Only in the last months of her life did it appear that her policy might not be sustained, because of the changed situation in England and France.
In that sense, she died a failure; but she died with the respect, even admiration, not just of her supporters, but of those Protestant lords who had struggled against her.

I claim no copyright for the expression, but since first hearing it regularly find myself considering people in terms of whether they are &bquo;earthed&equo; or not.
Subjectivity is a daily pitfall but I seem to observe that being &bquo;earthed&equo; has little to do with intellect, class, fortune or even belief. [/p] [p]
I know of the most intellectual of men and women who are not &bquo;earthed&equo; and some of the humblest who are.
I know Quakers [pb] who are &bquo;earthed&equo; and quakers who are not &bquo;earthed&equo; and never will be.
Perhaps it all has to do with being unworldly and prepared to believe in the little people at the end of the garden.

Along with the 480 watt machine comes an adjustable fence, wrenches, straight and curved guides, template guide, and even a free straight cutter. [/p] [p]
Most recent models of 6mm collet routers now produce around twice the power of this model; this is not so much to speed the work, but more to improve the quality and variety of profiles made by cutters.
Having said this, the Woodworker has a respectable 26,000rpm cutter speed, and it's also fairly light at 2kg. [/p] [p]
Cutters are fixed in place by the wrench and tommy bar method.
This is also used on some rival d-i-y machines, and is a cheaper option than a spindle lock, which needs only one tool to be used.
Care must be taken to remove the tommy <head>bar</head> from the collet before switching on the motor &mdash; it is all too easy to forget, and the result is a worn motor. [/p] [p]

A wealth of fascinating history lies within the very name of the Hundred House Hotel which refers to the ancient subdivisions of the shires of England into areas known as &bquo;hundreds&equo;.
In the courtyard, a 14th-century half-timbered and thatched roof building was for many centuries the local courthouse where justice was meted out.
The remains of stocks and the whipping post serve as uncomfortable reminders of the not so good old days. [/p] [p]
The main building is Georgian with very attractive exposed brickwork, beamed ceilings and oak panelling.
The d&eacute;cor is very pretty; period furniture, lots of wood, patchwork and brass &mdash; everything one feels a country inn should be.

On the credit side, there is much for the parents as well as the teenagers to gain when the time comes for them to leave home.
The children learn to take responsibility for themselves.
However hard parents try to inculcate a sense of responsibility in their children, the habits of childhood die hard.
Most mothers haven't the heart to deny their children the care and comfort they have given them all their lives and many continue to run round them long after they are old enough to look after themselves.
In order to become a responsible adult, a young man or woman must learn the cost of living, in terms of hard cash and hard work.
While they are living at home, so many things are thrown in free.
It can come as a shock to have to buy every stamp, tube of toothpaste or <head>bar</head> of soap as well as to wash and press favourite clothes before going out, and to change and launder their own bed linen. [/p] [p]

In addition, it was difficult to find impartial jurors.
Among the Sinhalese and Tamils, Clarence argued, convictions [pb] were difficult when the accused had a position of influence.
Burghers presented another problem: &bquo;With regard to the Eurasians, it is notoriously difficult, even upon the strongest evidence to induce a jury, in which the Eurasians are in a majority, to convict a Eurasian.&equo;
Clarence also asserted that cultural and language differences could produce misunderstandings.
European jurors know little about Sri Lankans, while Sinhalese and Tamil jurors did not always know English well enough to understand the judge. [/p] [p]

For your &pound;3 entrance fee, you were invited into a dingey outer bar, packed to capacity with strange anarcho-punk types who only appear at night.
At the bar a leather-clad schoolboy was buying a pint of lager, served in a plastic beaker.
Occasionally, the decibel level would rise from the merely conversation-stopping to Heathrow proportions.
This was when somebody opened the door to the inner sanctum where the support band was playing.
Here, in a room even estate agents would have difficulty describing as anything other than small, 20 people clung to the perimeter walls as a man with a Chris Waddle haircut hammered out some old rock cliches.
One fan sang along and plucked at an imaginary guitar, but he turned out to be the roadie.

No, because in the case of the Beethoven Seventh, he may not have learnt that quick music sounds dull unless every note is articulated. [/p] [p]
The last movement of this symphony is certainly a case in point. [/p] [p]
When I was a young conductor in Germany it was usual to conduct the finale much slower than we hear it nowadays.
And I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't get out of this tradition because of the difficulty of realizing the inner content of the music.
It did not &mdash; how can I put it? &mdash; lend itself to a faster tempo.
Then, eventually, both things were joined: the right tempo and the content.
Sometimes, especially in Romantic music, I tell the orchestra, &bquo;Now play everything as you played it but play a 4/4 bar.
What you are doing is feeling the music so deeply that you are playing a 5/4 <head>bar</head> .

The lead-in note to bars 1, 3 and 5 (also 18, 20 and 22, which are identical to these) are lowered by the tremolo arm before you pick them, in order to achieve the &bquo;slide&equo; effect of a &bquo;trombone&equo;.
Picking the note and then letting go of the arm allows the note to rise in pitch, giving that requisite smooth gliss into the note.
(Look back at the Cliff Gallup solos we [corr] covered[/corr] in June and July and you'll notice he did just that, too.) [/p] [p]
For the first of these (bar 1), hold the C chord I've diagrammed: press the tremolo arm to lower the C note (string 5, fret 3) to a B (equivalent to fingering at fret 2, and the reason I've written &bquo;2&equo; in the tab as the lead-in.

If you get a job as a shop assistant or checkout operator, one of the first things you will learn is till procedure.
There are so many different types of tills and cash registers in use today that it would be impossible to describe them all; they range from the old &bquo;press button&equo; type to modern, computerised systems.
If your job involves using a till, you will be given training in how to operate it. [/p] [div3] [head]
Some basic functions [/head] [p]
If you work in a large store or supermarket, you may well have an automatic, computerised till.
The assistant simply keys in a code number, or uses a special &bquo;light pen&equo; to &bquo;read&equo; the <head>bar</head> code on the item &mdash; and the till does the rest: displays the cost of the item, and shows the amount of change needed, once the assistant has keyed in the amount given by the customer.

In their infinite wisdom, the SFA had arranged for a Scotland Under 23 side to travel with the senior squad, in the admirable but ultimately naive belief that it would be a learning experience for the young stars of the future.
It was.
Three of the players, Willie Young and Arthur Graham of Aberdeen and the Celtic sweeper Pat McCluskey were all members of a Scotland under 23 team who had won the night before in Frederikshavn.
They learned to their cost the subtle art of starting a rammy in a Danish disco. [/p] [p]
Billy Bremner led by example.
The wee ginger-haired midfielder who was once described as &bquo;a volcano looking for somewhere to explode,&equo; took his men on a drinking spree that stretched from the downstairs <head>bar</head> of the Marina Hotel to an exclusive Copenhagen night club called &bquo;Bonaparte's&equo;, and back again.

In program terms, we can imagine a high-level command: [quote] [p]
GIVE ME A DRINKING SENSE OF THIS WORD IF THERE IS ONE [/p] [/quote]
and the response to such a command could be to hand up some dictionary definition of a bar as a drinking place.
I am not advocating such a theory of parsing English into formal representations &mdash; I happen not to believe strongly in such &bquo;top &mdash; down&equo; theories, though there are several relatively successful ones in the literature.
The point is that there could be such a command and at the level of that command where, as it were, the answer would be received, no information would ever be received about the other senses of &bquo;<head>bar</head> &equo; that the system as a whole might happen to know about in its dictionary, and the procedures for surveying that range of senses would never be revealed.

The function of the biceps is to bend the elbow, supinate the forearm and flex the shoulder.
As with the triceps, to develop larger biceps heavy basic exercises such as barbell curls or dumb-bell curls must be performed.
Dumb-bell curls should always involve rotation of the dumbbells.
This means that the biceps have been worked through their complete range of movement, aiding complete development. [/p] [p]
Forearm training is frequently omitted because of all the work the forearms do while training other body parts.
Higher repetitions must be used because the muscle type is denser and more resilient (like the calves).
Wrist rolling is probably one of the best exercises to perform.
This involves holding out a bar at arm's length and then rotating it.
A weight can be tied to the <head>bar</head> by a piece of rope and then raised and lowered to make the exercise more difficult. [/p] [p]

Though literary festivals could be immensely enjoyable, especially if they took you to some pleasant distant city, like Toronto or Adelaide, there was something absurd about writers gathering together in this way.
We were all of us separate and self-absorbed; each one wrote what he was able to write.
The absurdity became clearer if one imagined twenty or thirty writers from another era occupying the air-conditioned coach that took us from the Hyde Park Regis to the Riverside.
Suppose &mdash; I reflected that evening &mdash; Stendhal, Lamartine, Poe, Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, De Quincey, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley, Ann Radcliffe, Leigh Hunt, Mickiewicz, Pushkin, Gogol, Goethe, and a dozen other well-known, forgettable writers were making this journey.

The child could not decide whever he wanted a chocolate bar or a scoop of ice cream: it occurred to Nelson to combine the two. [/p] [p]
After months of experimentation he came up with a vanilla ice cream bar on a stick, bonded with cocoa butter to a coating of chocolate. [/p] [p]
Initially, Nelson called this the &bquo;I-Scream&equo; bar.
This was because a slogan &mdash; which he himself coined &mdash; had been set to music and became a hit tune of the period: &bquo;I-Scream, you scream.
WE all scream.
FOR ICE CREAM!&equo; [/p] [p]
Nelson, however, feared that once the song was no longer in vogue, his product would become similarly unfashionable.
He accordingly renamed it the &bquo;Eskimo Pie&equo; and chose the distinctive Eskimo symbol that still appears on the wrapping.
The <head>bar</head> was patented and Nelson duly became president of the Eskimo Pie Corporation. [/p] [p]

If the authorities had had any sense, they would have closed the cafes.&equo; [/p] [p]
Prague's cafes have been the centre of cultural activity since the days of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
So potent is the tradition of Czech cafe society, that most cafes were shut down after the Communist takeover in 1948. [/p] [p]
To prevent opposition forces coalescing, the authorities went to great length to separate the various strands of artistic and intellectual thought. [/p] [p]
Separate organisations were created for, among others, officially approved painters, writers and architects, with each group being allocated an official meeting place.
Contact between the different groups was actively discouraged. [/p] [p]

The Vauxhall HPC Seven is so powerful that Caterham took the unusual step of offering a high performance driving course in the price of the car (between &pound;18,200 and &pound;23,000), compulsory for the under 25s. [/p] [p]
For the past few years, Caterham has produced a new model every year, whether it be with a different engine, or new suspension or an entire new series such as the Rover K-Series.
The annual models provide good publicity at the Motor Show, but surely there is a limit to what can be done to a car that has to be instantly recognisable by its shape?
&bquo;There is a limit to everything.
No doubt we will run out of ideas one day.&equo; [/p] [p]

The committee's findings were broadly in line with what the Law Society wanted, according to Mr Peter Ely, its president, although the committee's opposition to employed solicitors appearing in higher courts went against the society's wishes. [/p] [p]

This month I would like to continue our study of double stops by taking a look at some examples of their usage in blues playing.
The first example shown in fig 1 is a fairly typical intro idea, taken from the intro of Jimi Hendrix's [hi]Red House [/hi].
Bars 1&ndash;2 of this part rely on the intervals of thirds, sixths and flat fifths &mdash; or in other words the interval structure of the B7 and Bb7 dominant chord structures that are used.
This is then followed by some b7-root bends and a descending blues scale phrase.
Notice in this how the major 7th (A&sharp;) is used as a passing tone. [/p] [p]
Double-stops abound in nearly all aspects of blues playing.
The next example (fig 2) shows a 12 <head>bar</head> &bquo;walking bass&equo; rhythm part idea in which each bass note is followed by an open string double-stop.

Because it was a Peculiar, the priory church had four wardens &mdash; one of their duties was to enforce the wearing of woolly hats on Sundays: failure to comply brought a fine of fourpence. [/p] [p]
Adjoining the churchyard is the Buttermarket, but only in name now.
The butter booths and the fire station have been removed but the local branch of the Heritage Society has restored the old town lock-up, known as the penny cells.
Men who were drunk at market were put in these cells till sober, and then had to pay a penny to get out.
There were two tiny windows, each with one bar across originally, but friends of the prisoners delayed the sobering up process by passing jugs of ale through the windows, so two bars were fitted.
Nothing daunted, the bearers of comfort brought a flagon of ale and a long clay pipe.
They put the bowl in the ale and the stem through between the <head>bars</head> &mdash; perhaps Snaith invented drinking straws.

Niki eats up a few places and then finds himself at the back of a bunch of five cars behind Prost, who is running second.
Niki is behind Johansson and he can't get past: Stefan's Toleman is faster on the straights and the track has few other places for overtaking.
Johansson is driving the race of his life and he knows he is in charge of the championship, even if it's not going to be his.

Moving cells around the sheet is done by a similar drag &bquo;n&equo; drop process, but it's less well implemented than Excel's.

He was used to walking all over the city, as if searching, as if dedicated to the act of searching, every single day; and now he came to The Bar every single night, and did his searching there.
Of course now he didn't have to walk quite so far to do his searching; but a similar kind of dedication was still required of him, for The Bar contained in a way the streets of the whole city, there were men there from all the different parts of it.
What Boy had to do now was not walk down those streets, but stand still and choose [pb] amongst their inhabitants, choose the right one to follow, the right one to lead him in the next stage of his journey or wandering through the city.

Though the service is available only in California, Telelawyer founder
Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states.  He says his
aim is to reach people who are bedridden, have no access to transportation,
ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers '
consultation fees.  Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to
lure clients to his doorstep.  ``We will only deal with clients on the phone,''
he says.  ``We have no in-office business.'' Telelawyer is apparently the
only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office

Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr.
O'Kicki one of the finest judges ``not only in Pennsylvania but in the
United States.'' Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments.
After practicing law locally, he was elected to his first 10-year term as
judge in 1971; in 1981, he was effectively re-elected.  Six years ago,
Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State
Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges.  He has been considered several
times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in
Pennsylvania.  And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court
seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania <head>Bar</head> Association rated him
``one of the best available,'' after interviewing local lawyers.

PROFESSOR GRIFF, rap fans won't need reminding, is the chap whose intemperate outbursts concerning global zionist conspiracies and the like, caused embarrassment even among his then collaborators, Public Enemy, and led to his ultimate departure from that fold.
On this, his first solo offerings, the humble Professor demonstrates that he has by no means mellowed. [/p] [p]
The spleen-venting and copious invective contained herein, is in much the same vein as that which brought Public Enemy notoriety as self-styled rap terrorists.
However, while P.E. 's recent offerings have utilised more varied styles and no small amount of wit in conveying their basic concerns, Professor Griff elects to revert to the dour, bludgeoning style which characterised P.E.

Vic tried to argue that it didn't make any difference how many toilets you had, it was the number of times you flushed them that mattered, but his father was convinced that having so many toilets was an incitement to unnecessary peeing, therefore to excessive flushing. [/p] [p]
He could be right, at that.
At Gran's house, a back-to-back in Easton with an outside toilet, you didn't go unless you really had to, especially in the winter.
Their own house in those days, a step up the social ladder from Gran's, had its own indoor toilet, a dark narrow room off the half-landing that always niffed a bit, however much Sanilav and Dettol his mother poured into the bowl.

About a third of these costs are met by the Church Commissioners, who generated investment income of &pound;140.8 million in 1989.
This sum met almost all the pension costs of 10,000 clergy pensioners and widows.
It also provided approximately 40% of the stipends and housing costs of the 11,500 serving clergy. [/p] [p]
Donations from the man or woman in the pew form the Church of England's other big source of income.
In 1988 (the last available figures), some 1,165,000 churchgoers (measured by usual Sunday attendance) put a total &pound;166.7 million in the plate.
This figure reflects an active drive on the part of the church to increase giving from, for example, a 1978 total of &pound;53.7 million.
The increase has outstripped inflation, but any parish priest will tell you that both the number of &bquo;<head>bums</head> on pews&equo; and the amount they donate are disappointing. [/p] [p]

Indeed, the colour of your breeches is very important, at least, if the rules are anything to go by.
The BSJA rules, for example, dictate: &bquo;Breeches or jodhpurs [hi]must [/hi] be white, pale yellow or fawn colour&equo;.
You can almost hear the old majors in charge of the sport muttering &bquo;got to be properly dressed&equo;, but the next two rules concern the wearing of hard hats and only &bquo;recommend&equo; that they comply with British Standards. [/p] [p]
In other words, you could ride into the ring with a home-made hard hat that would have to be accepted if it had a &bquo;harness secured to the shell at more than two points&equo;, but they can pull you up for wearing black jodhs!

Erm if it's um well generally speaking I think, thinking about what the sort of consensus would be among people who who study this sort of thing, they're usually looking for some sort of of discrepancy in ages or powers or something.

We paddle past Bank Holiday beaches, through sailing regattas and literally hundreds of swans.
We are through Sunbury and there is Hampton Court on the left.
Only 22 miles to go.
Late afternoon and we are at Teddington and the Tideway.
We are well fed and watered by our willing support and once more I am into the fear of the unknown.
I have heard every horror story about the Tideway and have believed them all, fool that I am!
I demure about continuing and if our support hadn't forced me towards the river then the watching crowd would have done so.
The river is full to the brim and quite placid so we set off again.
Richmond, Kew, Chiswick, Barnes, the banners are out for the recently finished Boat Race.

But for me, soon after the operation, there occurred something so removed from anything I had ever experienced that I have never forgotten it.
The operation took place at midday and I was taken to the recovery room in the course of the afternoon.
I was conscious soon after, and for the next few hours was in a state of half-sleeping, half-waking, yet aware of the presence of a pretty young nurse, perhaps Thai or Korean, who alternated between giving me sips of water and jabbing a needle in my <head>bum</head> .

Crazy Cock &mdash; originally rejoicing in the blissfully embarrassing title Lovely Lesbians &mdash; is an early work, and it shows.

Drawing on the trauma Miller suffered when his wife enjoyed a lesbian affair with a failed artist, it tells of the trauma a writer suffers when his wife&hellip;
Miller's imagery is heavy-handed in its efforts to startle, along the lines of &bquo;he had his words copulate with one another to bring forth empires, scarabs, holy water, the lice of dreams and the dream of wounds&equo;.

Many felt that to be denied the use of a fishing net for 4 months each year was the removal of a fundamental human right.
Slooten and Dawson were accused of fabricating their data, and of failing to count dolphins accurately. [/p] [p]
The controversy created by the research suddenly put Hector's dolphin firmly in the public eye.
Before the study began, few people knew about the dolphin, but the upsurge in public interest prompted many locals to claim that they were seeing more dolphins recently than ever before, whereas in fact they had probably just taken greater notice of something that had always been there.
Others agreed with the idea of a sanctuary, but suggested that it should be situated somewhere else where there would be no conflicts with recreational fishing, prompting Steve Dawson to draw the analogy of &bquo;putting a plaster on your <head>bum</head> to treat a boil on your forehead.&equo; [/p] [p]

The Liverpool Street dungeon was known, incongruously, as the gymnasium, presumably in memory of its intended purpose, though it had long been used for general storage.
In preparation for the [hi]Kindertransporte [/hi], the room was cleared of boxes and other flotsam.
Close to the door, rows of slatted chairs were set out behind a rope barrier.
At the far end was hung a large tarpaulin.
[pb] A large handwritten notice was propped up by the door &mdash; [hi]B&uuml;rge bleibt hier [/hi] (guarantors' seats here) &mdash; with an arrow pointing that way.
Behind the tarpaulin there were tables and <head>chairs</head> for the RCM workers, mostly, as an American journalist noticed, elegantly turned-out young ladies who looked &bquo;a good deal more like a junior league committee getting together to discuss a costume ball than officials waiting to sort out a trainload of Jewish refugee children&equo;.

During a study of the various styles, it became apparent to me that if the back legs are set into the seat rails at an angle, this angle, together with the curvature of the rear legs and backward slope of the chair back can regulate the flair: if the legs are mounted at right angles to the rear seat rail, there would be no flair.
Increasing this angle increases the flair very sensitively, up to the maximum deflection of the curve of the rear leg, if it were to be (impractically!) mounted in the plane or the rear seat rail. [/p] [p]
The requirement for robustness also demands that there be leg braces to create a strong rectangle around the rear seat joint, the point of maximum strain in all chairs.
Anyone who has had to reglue chairs will be painfully aware of this fact.
A crossmember between these two braces helps; people frequently put their legs back under their chair seats, and a cross brace between the front legs would be in the way. [/p] [p]

Here, the argument is presented that conceptual levels of understanding are necessary precursors to the emergence of spoken language, since language is, in effect, the linguistic realisation of those conceptual distinctions already established at a non-verbal level.
When conceptual distinctions are expressed in language they are referred to as [hi]semantic [pb] relations [/hi].
While emphasising the interdependence between semantic expres&rehy;sions and underlying cognitive concepts, this approach also implies that not all of a child's understanding of a particular experience may be expressed in language, and that a child may [hi]intend [/hi] to express more than she is actually able to encode formally in language structures.
For example, Chapter 1 discussed the ways in which researchers have introduced the notion of a &bquo;rich interpretation&equo; of utterances such as &bquo;sweater <head>chair</head> &equo;, &bquo;Daddy car&equo; in order to disambiguate alternative meanings. [/p] [p]

The Committee even considered the possibility that the occupant of the Chair be given a cut-off button or that other devices be employed to override demonstrations or disturbance in the galleries or on the floor of the House, but it rejected such innovations.
It did not want any kind of disorder to be filmed, including unparliamentary behaviour by Members (or even Members trying to attract attention by wearing fancy dress or clothes bearing slogans), and it therefore recommended that in all cases of disruption or disorder the director should cut to wide-angle shots, which would not show the offending incident, or to the occupant of the Chair. [/p] [p]
In practice, the rules regarding the treatment of incidents of serious disorder remain largely untested, as there were few such occasions during the experiment.

You would be surprised to know how little alcohol is needed to affect your concentration; you certainly do not have to be drunk.
If you have had more than a little alcohol you would probably become so relaxed that you fell asleep and nothing the therapist was saying would register at all.
You would be wasting not only the therapist's time but your own money too. [/p] [p]
So use your common sense.
A light meal without alcohol about an hour or so before your treatment is just about right. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
What will I have to do? [/head] [p]
All you have to do is to be willing to co-operate with the hypnotherapist as he gently takes you through the relaxation exercise to the hypnotic state.
You will either be lying on a couch or sitting in a comfortable <head>chair</head> with a back high enough to support your head.

When we reached our yard again I could see that Mrs Taylor and her friends had worked hard.
The trestles had been put up and were covered with white tablecloths of American oilcloth.
They were piled with corned-beef sandwiches, cheeses, sausage rolls, sliced pickled onions, beetroot, all kinds of pickles, watercress, pig's pudding and every mouthwatering delicacy you could think of.
And standing in the centre was a two-tiered, iced cake.
At one end of the table there were four stone gallon jars of ale, bottles of stout, gin and whisky.
There was room on the benches for twenty guests each side, facing each other.
We children had a table to one side to ourselves on which were laid out bottles of pop, cakes, buns and bread and jam. [/p] [p]
While the adults sat on their forms we sat ourselves down on an assortment of broken <head>chairs</head> borrowed from the neighbours.

The weeks passed and Sarah and Maggie took in washing to pay the rent, but there was never enough money left to buy more than bread and a few vegetables.
Sarah's arms and legs were getting thinner every day, and the rag mat she'd started making for the hearth became too heavy to have on her lap.
But she was relieved to see Patrick thrive at last now that Maggie had been weaned off gin, and when Rosa's sixth baby arrived she helped with it, gaining experience for when her own time came. [/p] [p]

You should also avoid exposure to large doses of synthetic chemicals, [pb] such as from household timber treatment or crop-spraying (see p 249). [/p] [p]
There are also other measures that can improve overall health and make the body more resilient.
These include correcting nutritional deficiencies (see p 261), taking regular exercise, eating a good, healthy diet and reducing stress.
Tackling underlying problems such as [hi]Candida [/hi] overgrowth (see p 183) or hyperventilation (p 155) will also help considerably.
Try to get outdoors, to somewhere with clean air, as often as you can, and take some strenuous exercise to improve your general health and fitness. [/p] [p]
For those with severe chemical sensitivity, creating a chemical-free &bquo;oasis&equo; in the house can be very valuable.

The idea of entitlement probably represents an attempt, during a much longer debate about the need for a &bquo;national&equo; curriculum, to bring into focus the child's individual needs and rights: it is needed to counterbalance any propensity towards the state's collective needs &mdash; totalitarianism if you will &mdash; which a move towards a nationally prescribed curriculum might bring with it. [/p] [p]
Of course debate about the National Curriculum has been around a lot longer, but its popularisation and public debate is a relatively recent phenomenon.
It was a &bquo;secret garden&equo; at least to David Eccles who when Secretary of State for the second time, in 1962, was determined (against the better judgement of many of its guardians) to strip it of its secrecy.
Eccles' vehicle for clearing the garden's secrecy was the Schools Council &mdash; not a very efficient or fast-moving garden Rotavator.
When James Callaghan accelerated the debate in 1976, the quality of discussion was indeed raised, in what turned out to be the Schools Council's declining years, under the combined influence of the <head>Chair</head> , John Tomlinson, and the Secretary, John Mann.

I had sold the contents of the cottages to the incoming purchaser, as well as several large pieces from the melin which would have been quite out of place in a modern house.

When planning your excursions in Madeira, let the morning sun be your guide in deciding whether you go east or west because it is quite common for one part of the island to bask in sunshine while another is cloudy.
The weather is one thing we cannot plan for as, although Madeira enjoys a good climate all year round, you must remember it is a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. [/p] [p]
Given the topography of Madeira, it is understandable that the island roads are full of twists and turns, climbing and descending all the time.
If you are hiring a car in the island, you will need three to four days to cover most of the main roads and to savour some of the breathtaking views.
There are various maps to show you the way, and we recommend you take a picnic with you, as most viewpoints also have picnic tables and <head>chairs</head> and space to pull your car off the road.

There were cries of &bquo;yes&equo;.
They also approved his call for an extension of the boundary and he commented, &bquo;This is democracy.&equo;
He then vacated the chair saying, &bquo;on second thoughts, it is not a decent chair for a man to be seen in&equo;.
When the Unionists returned they approved a motion for the council to go into committee, which would require the gallery to be cleared.

There were cries of &bquo;take the chair&equo; and Hegarty walked up to the mayor's chair.

We have nothing like it, only a view across the green.
When The Gantry was a private house, many years ago now, she came here, to balls and parties, it was quite the social centre of the county.
Oh, she talks about it so much, just as though it were yesterday.
The house is in her bones.
She was so fond of it.

Mitzi tried to rise quickly but her sixteen stones were against all precipitous action.
She intended to slap Elisabeth on the back, but she was too late; Elisabeth had made a dash for fresh air and Mitzi's arm met that of Elisabeth's chair.
Mitzi was immediately conscious of pain and seconds later of the table upturning and its entire contents spreading themselves across the parquet.
By the time Elisabeth was out of the Hall and on to the terrace, the guests at The Tamarisks were all frozen in shocked suspension, their forks lifted half-way to their mouths, their faces pale, their palms clammy. [/p] [p]

Giuliano Briganti, art historian and critic, died suddenly 17 December in Rome, aged seventy-four.
He was, with Giulio Argan who predeceased him by a month, and Federico Zeri, perhaps the leading opinion-former in the Italian art world, known to the general public from his articles in L'Espresso and then, from 1977, La Repubblica.
Trained by Roberto Longhi, he took part in the 1950s, together with Longhi and Argan, in the legation for the restitution of works of art removed to Germany during the war.
His academic career included the <head>Chair</head> in Contemporary art history at the University of Siena and his bibliography ranges from Mannerism to the Metaphysical painters and Guttuso.

At other times he would come running in answer to her call to find her seated before the stove with her legs stretched out to the fire and her face softened by smiles.

The 1966 congress of the CPNI adopted a &bquo;Democratic Programme for Unity&equo;, which included demands for the electoral law in Northern Ireland to be brought into line with that in Britain, except for the reintroduction of proportional representation and the abolition of cash deposits by candidates. [/p] [p]
The CPNI was not instrumental in creating NICRA but it was well represented on its first executive committee: Noel Harris of AUEW TASS, a CPNI member, was the first chairman; Derek Peters of the CPNI was secretary; and Betty Sinclair of the Belfast trades council was elected to the committee.
At the meeting which adopted the constitution, Ken Banks of AUEW TASS was added to the executive committee; he was close to the CPNI, although not actually a member.
However, at the first annual general meeting in February 1968, Banks and Harris were not returned to the executive committee and although Sinclair replaced Harris in the <head>chair</head> , Peters was replaced as secretary by John McAnerney of the CSJ.

The body was divided into two small and one large compartments, which could be divided in the centre by folding doors.
For night travelling, brass bedsteads with handsome eiderdown quilts were provided.
The floors were covered with green figured Wilton pile carpet laid on grey felt throughout the saloon, except in the attendant's compartment and balconies. [/p] [p]

Mr Gorman recently trained to become a chiropractor. [/p] [p]
The basic principle of his chair is that the knees should be below the pelvis, a quite different principle to the design of most chairs.
The usual type of chair puts an enormous strain on the spine, back muscles and many of the internal organs.
Anyone sitting down for extensive periods (as we all had to do in our school days) would have to tense many of the body's muscles in order to sit up straight.
This, in turn, causes the organs, the bones and, ultimately, the entire system to be under stress. [pb] [/p] [p]
The forward-tilting chair allows the spine and the postural muscles to support and balance the body naturally.
You can easily see the effect by placing a telephone book under each of the rear legs of a ordinary kitchen <head>chair</head> .

Everyone would nod.
Others in the group argued that up to a point all those things were right, but that often a subject was complex, often it could be constructive for everyone to have a chairperson who would guide discussion, not control it, who would be able to be supportive when someone talked too much or too little.
We should [pb] develop or modify existing structures as well as work out new ones.

In an age in which almost every worthwhile appointment likely to attract a gentleman could be obtained only through political interest, true independence was a luxury for a few wealthy bachelors without close kin, and politicians were expected to satisfy their constituents' needs.
Two bribe-hungry burgesses of North Berwick explained matters quite plainly in a letter which they wrote to Henry Erskine when the latter became Lord Advocate of Scotland in 1806.
They advised [gap] [pb] [/p] [p]
Henry Erskine's correspondents could have added to their list several other varieties of revenue officer, judicial appointments, university <head>chairs</head> , first appointments in the army or the navy, and where these could be obtained without purchase, advancement in rank in these services, Indian and colonial patronage, and much more.

The DHAC had proved that new and imaginative methods of protest could make an impact on the Unionist administration at the Guildhall, but for most opponents of the Unionist Party in Derry this was a reason for achieving a greater degree of anti-Unionist unity in order to press home their advantage, not to become equally [pb] hostile to the Nationalist Party.
This was shown by the first major DHAC protest following the 5 October 1968 demonstration, when the committee supported an NILP delegation to the council on the housing issue.
There was uproar when the council refused to hear the delegation and the meeting was adjourned, the Unionists withdrawing but the Nationalists remaining in their seats.
Eamonn Melaugh went over to the mayor's chair and sat down.
He shouted to the protesters: &bquo;I ask you citizens of Derry, do you approve of a crash programme of 2,000 houses?&equo;
There were cries of &bquo;yes&equo;.
They also approved his call for an extension of the boundary and he commented, &bquo;This is democracy.&equo;
He then vacated the <head>chair</head> saying, &bquo;on second thoughts, it is not a decent chair for a man to be seen in&equo;.

I literally jumped for joy when I heard that key turn in the lock and saw Mum and Mrs Taylor enter with another woman.
As they banged the door shut, the vibration set Granny's chair rocking and I put my hands over my eyes.
But Mum wouldn't have that. [pb] [/p] [p]
&bquo;Yer don't 'ave ter look if yer don't wanta,&equo; she said sharply, pulling them away. [/p] [p]

I felt safer now that they'd arrived and I was curious to see what she meant by &bquo;laying out&equo;.
So, avoiding Granny's staring eyes, I watched Mum, Mrs Taylor and the big-bosomed woman they called Aggie lift Granny with some effort out of her chair and up the creaky stairs.
I stood engrossed by this until I heard the rocking <head>chair</head> creak behind me, and at that I scampered up after them.

My own taste for formal furniture tends to fall between the &bquo;Arts and Crafts&equo; and &bquo;Modern&equo;, rather than &bquo;Repro&equo;, and yet looking at modern designs you see in exhibitions, I doubt their &bquo;long-sit&equo; comfort and, personally, I feel that the limits of acceptable elegance are frequently passed by many, in the cause of being different.
The demand for elegance carries with it the requirement to fit in with existing furniture and although talking points can be useful, a table surrounded by a set of such chairs could be a positive eyesore.
Talking to professional designer-producers confirms this point: people will stop to admire such designs, but many more &bquo;traditional&equo; products are purchased. [/p] [p]
So we can put some limits on the project: the <head>chairs</head> must be upholstered; modern in the simplicity of their lines but not &bquo;Cubist&equo; for want of a better term; easy on the eye and bottom; they should fit in with other existing furniture; and naturally should be of strong construction so that they will be heirloom quality.

This needs to be placed at the angle which gives the best support for the material being used in relation to the pupil's vision, and some initial experimenting with different angles of work may be needed in order to settle on this.
A desk with an adjustable sloping top is useful as it provides storage space too, but probably the most practical aid, especially as the pupil progresses into secondary school, is a light, portable reading stand that can be easily taken from room to room as required.
It will need to have a ledge to support the reading material and strong clamps to hold pages in place are useful.
The earlier a pupil is able to find and keep to a comfortable and efficient working position, the better. [/p] [p]
Another factor in the pupil's near environment that can affect the comfortable use of vision for work is the &bquo;fit&equo; of the furniture (<head>chair</head> , desk, table) in terms of individual requirements.

The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp.,
which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing.  Campeau
developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest
payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up
for sale.  Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services
and York International, that are counting on at least $7 billion of
scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and
buy-outs afloat, may never get the money.  ``The music has stopped playing,''
says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins.
``You 've either got a <head>chair</head> or you do n't.''

Is that the forecast?'' Mr. O'Brien asks, trying to pin down the economist.
He does n't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of
interest-rate scenarios.  In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital
Management in Minneapolis, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem
ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.  Alfred Harrison, the manager,
shoves Mr. Straszheim's handout back at him: ``Do we want to go through this?
Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be
right?'' Swiveling in his <head>chair</head>, Mr. Straszheim replies
that the new outlook, though still weak, does n't justify calling a

Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before, but lately her
vacuum cleaner turned itself on, a telephone flew off its stand, doors
slammed inexplicably, and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen.  ``I
was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who
was there, and it was nobody,'' she says, eyes wide at the recollection.
Mr. Baker hears her out, pokes around a bit, asks a few questions and
proposes some explanations.  Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner, he says:
``Could be Cuddles, -LCB- Mrs. Stinnett's dog -RCB-.'' The flying telephone:
``You tangle the base cord around a <head>chair</head> leg, and the

Elisa Byler, a St. Louis masseuse, won over officials at Emerson Electric
Co., a maker of electrical and electronic equipment, by providing documents
and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage.  She
notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits.  ``I
pull my hair back, wear a little makeup and look corporate,'' says Ms. Byler,
who has been visiting Emerson since January.  ``If I go in there as I
normally dress, they 'd ask, ` Who is this hippie?  ''' The self-proclaimed
father of on-site massage is David Palmer, a 41-year-old San Francisco

Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage <head>chair</head> three

To help do this, Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years
ago that he hopes will bring ``structured touching'' into mainstream America.
``The culture is not ready to take off its clothes, lie down and be touched
for an hour for $45,'' he says.  ``The idea is to keep the clothes on and
to keep people seated.  The chair is a way to package massage.'' Sitting in
one of Mr. Palmer's chairs, which cost $425 and have since been copied by
others, is a bit like straddling a recliner.  Customers lean forward, rest
their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of
the <head>chair</head>.

Officials at Options Clearing Corp., which processes all options trades for
U.S. exchanges, said that the $50 million guarantee was unprecedented, but
was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets.  ``It
was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps,'' said Paul
Stevens, OCC president and chief operating officer.  Mr. Stevens declined
to give the specific contributions to the $50 million guarantee from each
participant.  But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp.
contributed $20 million to the guarantee, the CBOE put up $8 million, the
Amex added $4 million and $18 million came from Mr. Fossett's own assets.
Mr. Fossett could n't be reached to comment.  Debora Foster takes off her

Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a
company conference room; the department's supervised health facility would
have been fine.  ``In my view, -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with

attitudes, some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly.

unbeknownst to the company's executives.  He visits the same department
every two or three weeks.  His massage <head>chair</head> is kept in
